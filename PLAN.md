# Personal Library Project - Development Plan

## Project Overview

A personal library management system that allows users to track their reading progress, search for books using the OpenLibrary API, and manage their personal book collection with a modern, responsive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **API Integration**: OpenLibrary API

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

### 1.1 Backend Setup

- [x] Initialize Express.js TypeScript project
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL database connection
- [x] Set up Prisma ORM
- [x] Create database schema/models
- [x] Set up environment configuration
- [x] Add basic middleware (CORS, body parser, etc.)

### 1.2 Frontend Setup

- [x] Initialize React TypeScript project
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure build tools and development server
- [x] Install UI libraries (Material UI)
- [x] Set up responsive design framework

### 1.3 Development Tools

- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Configure TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Add pre-commit hooks
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend)

## Phase 2: Database Schema Design

### 2.1 Core Entities

- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Books**: Book information from OpenLibrary API
- **UserBooks**: Junction table for user's personal library
- **ReadingProgress**: Track reading status and progress
- **Authors**: Author information
- **Categories/Genres**: Book categorization

### 2.2 Database Schema

```sql
Users:
- id, email, username, password_hash, created_at, updated_at

Books:
- id, openlibrary_id, title, isbn, cover_url, description,
  publish_date, page_count, created_at, updated_at

Authors:
- id, name, bio, created_at, updated_at

BookAuthors:
- book_id, author_id (many-to-many relationship)

UserBooks:
- id, user_id, book_id, status (want_to_read, reading, completed),
  rating, review, date_added, date_started, date_completed,
  current_page, created_at, updated_at

Categories:
- id, name, description

BookCategories:
- book_id, category_id
```

## Phase 3: Backend API Development

### 3.1 Authentication System

- [x] User registration and login
- [x] JWT token management
- [x] Password hashing and validation
- [x] Protected route middleware

### 3.2 OpenLibrary Integration

- [x] Create service for OpenLibrary API calls
- [x] Book search functionality
- [x] Book details retrieval
- [x] Cover image handling
- [x] Rate limiting and caching

### 3.3 Core API Endpoints

- [x] POST /api/auth/register
- [x] POST /api/auth/login
- [x] POST /api/auth/refresh
- [x] GET /api/auth/profile
- [x] GET /api/books/search?q=query
- [x] GET /api/books/:id
- [x] POST /api/books (add book from OpenLibrary)
- [x] GET /api/user/books (with filters: status, category)
- [x] POST /api/user/books (add to personal library)
- [x] PUT /api/user/books/:id (update reading status/progress)
- [x] DELETE /api/user/books/:id (remove from library)
- [x] PUT /api/user/books/:id/progress
- [x] GET /api/user/stats (reading statistics)

## Phase 4: Frontend Development
